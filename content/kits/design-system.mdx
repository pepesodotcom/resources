# Modern Design System

A comprehensive design system that provides consistency and efficiency for building modern web applications.

## Design Tokens

### Color Palette
Our color system is built on semantic naming and accessibility-first principles:

- **Primary Colors** - Main brand colors for primary actions
- **Secondary Colors** - Supporting colors for secondary elements  
- **Neutral Colors** - Grayscale palette for backgrounds and text
- **Semantic Colors** - Success, warning, error, and info states

### Typography Scale
The typography system uses a modular scale for consistent hierarchy:

```css
--text-xs: 0.75rem;    /* 12px */
--text-sm: 0.875rem;   /* 14px */
--text-base: 1rem;     /* 16px */
--text-lg: 1.125rem;   /* 18px */
--text-xl: 1.25rem;    /* 20px */
```

### Spacing System
Consistent spacing using an 8px base unit:

- **Micro spacing** - 4px, 8px for tight layouts
- **Small spacing** - 12px, 16px for component padding
- **Medium spacing** - 24px, 32px for section gaps
- **Large spacing** - 48px, 64px for major sections

## Component Library

### Buttons
Multiple button variants for different use cases:

- **Primary** - Main call-to-action buttons
- **Secondary** - Alternative actions
- **Ghost** - Subtle interactive elements
- **Outline** - Bordered button style

### Forms
Comprehensive form components:

- Input fields with validation states
- Select dropdowns with search
- Checkboxes and radio buttons
- File upload components

### Navigation
Flexible navigation components:

- Header navigation with dropdown menus
- Sidebar navigation for dashboards
- Breadcrumb navigation
- Pagination controls

## Usage Guidelines

### Accessibility
All components meet WCAG 2.1 AA standards:

- Proper color contrast ratios
- Keyboard navigation support
- Screen reader compatibility
- Focus management

### Responsive Design
Mobile-first approach with breakpoints:

- **Mobile** - 320px to 767px
- **Tablet** - 768px to 1023px
- **Desktop** - 1024px and above

### Implementation
Use the design system with your preferred framework:

- React components available
- Vue.js components coming soon
- Vanilla CSS classes provided
- Figma design file included

## Getting Started

1. Install the design system package
2. Import base styles and tokens

The design system is continuously evolving based on user feedback and emerging patterns.
