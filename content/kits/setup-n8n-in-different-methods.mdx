# Setting Up n8n – Different Methods Explained

**Welcome!** In this guide, we’ll walk you through how to set up [n8n](https://n8n.io), the powerful open-source workflow automation tool that connects over 400+ services and enables powerful automation with a visual interface and AI features.

Whether you're a developer, business owner, or just want to automate repetitive tasks, this guide covers **five different ways** to get started with n8n—so you can pick the setup that works best for you.

---

## Overview of Setup Methods

There are several ways to install and run n8n, each with its own strengths:

* **Local Installation (npm)** – Quick setup for testing on your own machine.
* **Docker** – Isolated, consistent environments for container users.
* **Docker Compose** – Ideal for production with data persistence and database support.
* **n8n Cloud** – Easiest option, fully managed with a free trial.
* **Self-Hosting on AWS (EC2 or Lightsail)** – Best for scalable, production-grade deployments.

Let’s dive into each one step-by-step.

---

## 1. Local Installation Using npm

**Great for development or quick testing.**

### Steps:

1. **Install Node.js** (version 18+):
   Download it from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org).

2. **Install n8n globally**:

   ```bash
   npm install n8n -g
   ```

3. **Start n8n**:

   ```bash
   n8n start
   ```

4. **Access the interface**:
   Open [http://localhost:5678](http://localhost:5678)

### Optional: Enable webhooks (for development)

```bash
n8n start --tunnel
```

> ⚠️ Not recommended for production due to lack of persistence.

---

## 2. Running n8n with Docker

**Ideal for a clean, isolated containerized setup.**

### Steps:

1. **Install Docker** from [docker.com](https://www.docker.com).

2. **Create a Docker volume**:

   ```bash
   docker volume create n8n_data
   ```

3. **Run the n8n container**:

   ```bash
   docker run -it --rm --name n8n -p 5678:5678 -v n8n_data:/home/node/.n8n docker.n8n.io/n8nio/n8n
   ```

4. **Access n8n**:
   Open [http://localhost:5678](http://localhost:5678)

> Your workflows persist thanks to the volume.

---

## 3. Running n8n with Docker Compose

**Perfect for production use, with persistent data and more flexibility.**

### Prerequisites:

* Docker
* Docker Compose

### Example `docker-compose.yml`:

```yaml
version: '3'
services:
  n8n:
    image: docker.n8n.io/n8nio/n8n
    ports:
      - 5678:5678
    volumes:
      - n8n_data:/home/node/.n8n
    environment:
      - N8N_BASIC_AUTH_ACTIVE=true
      - N8N_BASIC_AUTH_USER=admin
      - N8N_BASIC_AUTH_PASSWORD=your_secure_password
volumes:
  n8n_data:
```

### Commands:

1. Save the file as `docker-compose.yml`.

2. Run the container in the background:

   ```bash
   docker-compose up -d
   ```

3. Open [http://localhost:5678](http://localhost:5678)

> You can secure it with basic auth, and extend it with databases like PostgreSQL. See [n8n-hosting repo](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n) for more configs.

## 4. Using n8n Cloud

**Zero setup, hosted by the creators of n8n (PAID).**

### Steps:

1. Go to [n8n.io](https://n8n.io) and **sign up**.
2. Choose a plan — **free trial available**.
3. Access your instance through the web interface.

> ⚡ Perfect for beginners or anyone avoiding infrastructure management.
> Slightly less customizable than self-hosting.

---

## 5. Self-Hosting on AWS (EC2 or Lightsail)

**Best for full control and scalability.**

### Option A: Using AWS Lightsail

1. Log in to [AWS Lightsail](https://lightsail.aws.amazon.com/).
2. Click **“Create Instance”** and select **Ubuntu**.
3. Choose a plan (e.g., 1 GB RAM or more).
4. Set up **SSH keys**.
5. Connect to your instance via SSH.
6. Install Docker and Docker Compose:

   ```bash
   sudo apt update
   sudo apt install -y docker.io docker-compose
   sudo systemctl enable --now docker
   ```
7. Follow the Docker Compose steps above to deploy n8n.

---

### Option B: Using AWS EC2

1. Launch an EC2 instance with Ubuntu or Amazon Linux.
2. Open port **5678** in the **Security Group**.
3. SSH into the instance.
4. Install Docker + Docker Compose.
5. Use the same Docker Compose setup as above.

>> Advanced users can configure HTTPS using **Nginx** and secure with authentication. Here's a guide to [Self hosting with EC2](https://youtu.be/G8EN8vCrZsM)

### Recap: Which Method Should You Choose?

| Method                | Best For                                       |
| --------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| `npm`                 | Local development & testing                    |
| `Docker`              | Containerized environments                     |
| `Docker Compose`      | Production use with persistence                |
| `n8n Cloud`           | Easiest option, no infrastructure required     |
| `AWS` (EC2/Lightsail) | Scalable, secure, production-grade deployments |

## Final Thoughts

n8n’s flexibility makes it a fantastic choice for workflow automation, whether you're just experimenting or running complex integrations in production. No matter how you choose to deploy it, always ensure:

* **Authentication is enabled**
* **HTTPS is configured for production**
